# Coding Interview Preparation Plan

## 4-Week Study Plan

### Week 1: Fundamentals and Data Structures
- **Day 1-2**: Review basic programming concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, functions).
- **Day 3-4**: Study arrays and strings.
- **Day 5-6**: Focus on linked lists (singly and doubly linked lists).
- **Day 7**: Practice problems on arrays, strings, and linked lists.

### Week 2: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Day 8-9**: Study stacks and queues.
- **Day 10-11**: Learn about trees (binary trees, binary search trees).
- **Day 12-13**: Focus on graphs (BFS, DFS).
- **Day 14**: Practice problems on stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### Week 3: Algorithms and Problem-Solving Techniques
- **Day 15-16**: Study sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort).
- **Day 17-18**: Learn about searching algorithms (binary search, linear search).
- **Day 19-20**: Focus on dynamic programming.
- **Day 21**: Practice problems on sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.

### Week 4: Mock Interviews and Review
- **Day 22-23**: Conduct mock interviews with a friend or use online platforms.
- **Day 24-25**: Review common interview questions and solutions.
- **Day 26-27**: Focus on system design basics.
- **Day 28-29**: Practice coding under timed conditions.
- **Day 30**: Rest and review key concepts.
